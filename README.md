# Particle System

## INTRODUCTION

## Particle:
In the physical sciences, a particle is a small localized object to which can be ascribed several physical or chemical properties such as volume or mass.
A particle can be a smoke, a spark, a drop of water, etc. Especially to give visual effects.

Particles are graphical primitives such as points, lines, your imagination:

## Particle System
Particle systems are one such technique. By creating a small physics system that throws around hundreds – even thousands – of tiny little particles, awesome visual effects like smoke, fire, sparks, rocket exhaust and many more can be created. They are simple to create and really add nice visual effects to your game.

## Atributes of Particle
To create a Particle System, it is necessary to set a series of attributes that will have each particle:

#### Position:
 - It is the position from where you are respawn, you can play with this value and establish an area from the center of the point and make it exit from a random place.
 - Example:

#### Speed:
 - The speed at which it will come out, here you can apply a force, for example: gravity or wind. This can increase realism.

#### Color:
 - Each particle has to have a color. For greater realism, it is better to have a variety of shades of the same color.
 - Example:

#### Life Time:
 - It is the life time of the particle. If you play with time so that each particle has a different one, you can get more relist effects.
 - Example:
 
 
#### Age:
 - To understand it better, if you have a particle that has 4 phases, childhood, young, adult and old. Each phase has a different color, with this you can play and tell you that some particles start in childhood and others in the following phases, so you get a greater realism.

#### Shape:
 - In my case I use squares but in other cases they can be lines, mini-balls, etc.
 - Example:

#### Size:
 - You can play with the size of the particles, if you use a small size you can achieve higher quality in some cases.
 - Example:

#### Transparency:
 - Transparency is important to bring realism to the particles. If you do not use it the player sees something strange.
